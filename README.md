# Project: Vim, C and C++
The purpose of this repo is really for going back to the fundamentals. Using vim to review the beginning of C and C++ when I first started studying computer science, which was not a pleasant experience.

# Why Vim?
I am an avid Emacs user. But sadly, it is not pre-installed with any Linux distro. I want to use this chance to get familiar with vim. Plus, I gradually feel the subtle issue with my left pinky :)
